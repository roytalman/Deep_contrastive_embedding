# Embedding_Contrastive
Deep supervised (or semi-supervised) contrastive learning for small datasets (few shot learning).
This repository takes labeled embedding data, that could be extracted from pre-trained NLP, vision, or any other algorithm that extract embedding,
and use deep FFN to learn new embedding that is fine-tuned for your subset of classes and data. 
This algorithm can improve classification performance even for small amount of data-per class.
