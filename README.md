# Embedding_Contrastive
Deep supervised contrastive learning for small datasets.
This repository takes labeled embedding data (it could be extracted from pre-trained NLP, vision, or any other algorithm that extract embedding),
and use deep FFN to learn new embedding that is fine-tuned for the current data. 
This algorithm can improve classification performance even for small amount of data-per class.
